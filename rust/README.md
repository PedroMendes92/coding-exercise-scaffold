# Rust

Skeleton project for Rust.\
It is assumed that Rust is installed on your machine. If not, please follow the [installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Usage
- `./script/test` to run the tests

## Structure
- Code located in [`main.rs`](./src/main.rs)
- Tests located in [`lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs)

However, you're free to organise your code as you like.
