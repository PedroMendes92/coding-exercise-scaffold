# Coding Exercise Project

This repository contains small skeleton projects in a number of programming languages. 

It is designed to aid in the coding exercise stage of the Azarc's recruitment process for Software Engineers. 


Note that there are no skeleton projects available for the Swift programming language. For iOS developer roles, coding exercises are ran in a blank Xcode playground.

## Setting up your environment

For the coding exercise you will need to be able to do two things:

- Write code in the language of your choice, sharing your screen to pair with the remote interviewer
- Run that code
- Optionally: write tests for the code you have written

These skeleton projects can be used to set up such an environment quickly should you wish but are not required.

If you have any issues with your environment please let your interviewer know as soon as you join the Hangout so that
they can adjust the exercise accordingly.
